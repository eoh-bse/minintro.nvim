# minintro.nvim
Extremely minimalistic intro screen for Neovim

## Motivation
Neovim intro screen can be extremely buggy and forced to close automatically by plugins installed such as 
[nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua), 
[bufferline](https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim), 
[lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) and many more.  
`minintro.nvim` hijects `no-name` and `directory` buffer and draws a simple intro logo.
If you just want a simple and lightweight startup intro that works, this plugin is for you.

## Installation
```lua
-- Lazy
{
    "eoh-bse/minintro.nvim",
    config = true,
    lazy = false
}
```

```lua
-- Packer
use {
    "eoh-bse/minintro.nvim",
    config = function() require("minintro").setup() end
}
```

## Configuration
There is only one option available for `minintro.nvim` and that is color of the intro logo. There is no need
to create a separate config file. Pass the config directly in your plugin installation file
```lua
-- Lazy
{
    "eoh-bse/minintro.nvim",
    opts = { color = "#98c379" }
    config = true,
    lazy = false
}
```

```lua
-- Packer
use {
    "eoh-bse/minintro.nvim",
    config = function() require("minintro").setup({ color = "#98c379" }) end
}
```

## Things to be aware of
If you have some sort of `tabline` plugin such as [bufferline](https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim),
`vim.opt.showtabline` will be overridden to `1`. This forces display of a buffer tab even when there is only
one. If you do not wanna see the tab, you can modify `bufferline`'s configuration like the following:
```lua
require("bufferline").setup({
    options = {
        always_show_bufferline = false
    }
})
```
The above configuration will effectively set `vim.opt.showtabline` to 2, meaning the tabs will only start to
display when there is more than one buffer open
